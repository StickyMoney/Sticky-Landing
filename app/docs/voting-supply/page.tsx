          <p>
            Each week, STICKY token holders vote on the allocation of incentives to different supply markets. The voting
            process works as follows:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Voting period opens every Thursday at 00:00 UTC</li>
            <li>Voters cast their votes for their preferred assets</li>
            <li>Voting closes on Sunday at 23:59 UTC</li>
            <li>Results are tallied and new incentives are implemented on Monday</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Voting Power</h2>
          <p>Your voting power is determined by:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>The number of STICKY tokens you hold</li>
            <li>The number of SYRUP tokens you hold (staked STICKY)</li>
            <li>The duration of your stake (longer stakes = more voting power)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The formula for calculating voting power is:</p>
          <pre className="bg-muted p-2 rounded-md overflow-x-auto">
            <code>Voting Power = STICKY balance + (SYRUP balance Ã— Stake Multiplier)</code>
          </pre>
          <p>Where the Stake Multiplier depends on your staking duration:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Flexible staking: 1x</li>
            <li>30-day staking: 1.5x</li>
            <li>90-day staking: 2x</li>
            <li>180-day staking: 3x</li>
